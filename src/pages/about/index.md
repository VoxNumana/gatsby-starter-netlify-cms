Hi, my name is Kevin Sorby and I am a kitchen designer from Sydney, Australia. I scour the web looking for kitchen ideas and then I post those things that might be of interest to people who are designing or remodeling their kitchen. 

So, browse the different categories to get information on different aspects of kitchen design and come back from time to time to check out new information that I have uncovered.
